			<h1> Pampanga </h1>
			<p> Pampanga is known as the Culinary Capital of the Philippines because it produces some of the best Filipino food, but this province in Central Luzon is more than simply its cuisine. In addition to being the location of the very contemporary and urbanized city of Clark, you may go trekking or attend popular events that showcase stunning Christmas lantern displays and hot air balloon rides. Just a few hours from Manila, Pampanga is a must-visit location for foodies, nature lovers, and those seeking vibrant festivals. </p>

			<h1> Did you know? </h1>
			<p>  Since the colonial era, Pampanga has had a rich gastronomic heritage. Legend has it that Spanish friars enjoyed the traditional cuisine of the area and that only Pampangueños make their meals. Local chefs were also in charge of creating the menu and the food served for the First Philippine Republic's inauguration at Malolos in January 1899. <br/>  It was also because of this arrangement that benefitted Pampangueños that the Spaniards were urged to teach the locals some of their cooking methods. Even now, the Spanish ancestry of Kapampangan food is still prominent, along with various flavors from Southeast Asia. </p>

		<h1> Sisig </h1>
		<p> Its history dates back to the year 1732, where, as an Augustinian friar described its earlier iteration, it initially featured a predominantly sour flavor profile—and was more of a salad than anything. It also featured heftier cuts of meat at the time. The dish then evolved during the American Occupation when American troops discarded pig heads and innards, ushering in a change in its main components. Lucia Cunanan, now credited for inventing the modern sisig, took these unwanted parts to create something new. She grilled them while adding new flavors to the dish. The rest is history.     </p>
